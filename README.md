## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow.

### What I learned


To see how you can add code snippets, see below:


```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  width: min(95%, 78rem);
  margin-inLine: auto;
}
{
grid-template-areas:
  'first first second fith'
  'third forth forth fith';
}
{
### Continued development

With basic understanding i have achieved so far,  think moving to frameworks like Node.js, React.js and JavaScript would not be a difficult task at all.
